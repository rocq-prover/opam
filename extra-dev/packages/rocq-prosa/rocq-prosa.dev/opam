synopsis: "A Foundation for Formally Proven Schedulability Analysis"
description: """Prosa is a repository of definitions and proofs for
real-time schedulability analysis. Prosa’s distinguishing characteristic
is that Prosa prioritizes readability over all other concerns to ensure
that specifications remain accessible to readers without a background in
formal proofs. (A background in real-time scheduling is assumed.)"""
