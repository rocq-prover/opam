synopsis: "A library for doing proofs by (enhanced) coinduction"
description: """
Coinductive predicates are greatest fixpoints of monotone functions.
The `companion' makes it possible to enhance the associated coinduction scheme.
This library provides a formalisation on enhancements based on the companion, as well as tactics in making it straightforward to perform proofs by enhanced coinduction.
